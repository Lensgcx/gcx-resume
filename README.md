## Introduction

`gcx-resume` is my first project many years ago.
After the completion of this project, I began to become a front-end programmer. Now I take this as a commemoration. I am proud of it!.

**Note: This project uses Jquery1.8.3+ version and Bootstrap**

## Preparation

You need to install [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) locally. The project is based on [ES2015+](http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/)、[vue](https://cn.vuejs.org/index.html)、[vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/zh-cn/)、[vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/zh-cn/) 和 [element-ui](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element). All data requests for this project are simulated using [Mock.js](https://github.com/nuysoft/Mock). It would be helpful if you have pre-existing knowledge on those.

 **This project is not a scaffolding and is more of an integrated solution.**

 **This project does not support low version browsers (e.g. IE). Please add polyfill yourself if you need them.**
